# Morning Reading  --  Park

(Tom and Vince are jogging, then they take a break.)

**Tom**: Hey Vince, thanks for comming to the park with me today. We've both been so busy, it's hard to find time to just hang out like we used to.

**Vince**: Yeah! I finally finshed up that project at work, so I can relax a little. Can you believe I've been working 7 days a week for 3 months?

**Tom**: That's rough, man. Well, you survived.

**Vince**ï¼š Yeah, and I made a ton of money, too!

**Tom**: Haha, that's the spirit!

**Vince**: Alright, let's keep jogging, I wanna get home before the sun sets.

**Tom**: Hang on, just give me one more minute to catch my breath. I haven't been jogging in a few months.

**Vince**: Hey Tom, do you see that?

**Tom**: What?

**Vince**: There's something under those bushes.

**Tom**: Where? Oh my god... Is that a person?

**Vince**: It looks like a dead body! I can see his shoes.

**Tom**: No way!

**Vince**: Well, it's obviously a man's body, and he's not moving.

**Tom**: Maybe he's just asleep. Don't worry, he'll wake up later.

**Vince**: Why would he be sleeping in the park under those bushes? That's no a normal thing to do!

**Tom**: Who cares, let's go outta here before anyone sees us.

**Vince**: What are you afraid of?

**Tom**: Look, I don't know what that guy is doing, but it's none of my business, and I don't want to get involved.

**Vince**: We can't just leave him there. What if he's really hurt?

**Tom**: It's probably a trick. If we touch him, he'll try to blame us. And, if he's dead, and somebody else sees us with him, they'll think that we killed him.

**Vince**: I'm calling the police.

**Tom**: No! If you call the police, they're gonna come and ask us a million questions! I just wanna go home now and have a quiet dinner with my wife. If he's dead, we can't help him anyways.

**Vince**: This is a human being with a family! He has parents, maybe a wife and kids who care about him! Their father is missing!

**Tom**: No, Vince! Don't touch him! I'm telling you, it's a trap!

**Vince**: I have to! Sir, sir!  Are you okay?? (shakes the shoes)

**Tom**: (gasp) His feet fell off!

**Vince**: No' they didn't. He's not dead. There's not even a body. It's just an empty pair of shoes and jeans under the bush. come on, let's get outta here.

**Tom**: Haha! You don't wanna call the policy anymore?

**Vince**: Why should I?

**Tom**:  Well, maybe those pants and shoes are stolen. Or maybe there's naked man running around somewhere whithout his pants!

**Vince**: Very funny. Ok,, let's start jogging again. You see? Now it's dark alreay. Look at how much time we wasted.

**Tom**: You started it!
