**Tom**:  We are gathered here today to celebrate the life of Vincent DiGiorno. A husband, a father, a brother, a friedn... He touched all of our lives in a special way. His smile will stay in our hearts forever. I knew Vince for over 30 years. We first met when...

**Vince**: Hey!

**Tom**:  Did you hear something? What was that noise?

**Vince**: Help! Where am I?

**Tom**:  Is that coming from the coffin?

**Vince**:  It's dark in here! Let me out! T'm trapped!

**Tom**:  Vince? Hang on, I'm comming!  ( He opens the coffin.)

**Vince**:  (Comes out of the coffin) Ah! What's happending?

**Tom**:  You died, but... You're alive!

**Vince**:  Of course I'm alive! What are all these people doing here? Why is everybody looking at me?

**Tom**:  This is your funeral. We were planning to bury you this afternoon.

**Vince**:  Bury me? But I feel fine!

**Tom**:  Don't your remember what happended?

**Vince**: No! Why does every think I'm dead? 

**Tom**:  We took you to the hospital. Your heart stopped beating and you weren't breathing.

**Vince**: But I feel so healthy! I don't smoke or drink, and I always exercise!

**Tom**: Right, but you were driving to fast, and you weren't wearing your seat belt.

**Vince**: So? I'm a safe driver.

**Tom**:  Well, you crashed into a tree and flew out of the car.

**Vince**: Oh. I hate wearing my seat belt. It's so unconmfortable.

**Tom**:  It's not supposed to be comfortables, it's there to save your life!

**Vince**: I guess so...

**Tom**: You know, the law says you have to wear it. If the police catch you you have to pay a fine.

**Vince**: How much?

**Tom**: $10,000 ( ten thousand dollars)

**Vince**: That's a lot!

**Tom**: ...and you might remember, I'm a police officer, so...

**Vince**: You wouldn't

**Tom**: I'm sorry, Vince. It's my job. Now that you're alive, I have to write you a ticket.

**Vince**:  No! But, I already died! Isn's that punishment enough?

**Tom**: I'm afraid I have no choice. Here you are. ( He gives Vince the ticket.) You can pay it online.

**Vince**: Some friend you are!

**Tom**:  Alright, ladies and gentlemen. Show's over. You can all go home now.
