# Morning Reading -- Flat Tire

**Tom**:  Hey there! Do you need a hand?

**Vince**: Don't worry. I'm alright. I can handle it myself, thanks!

**Tom**: Are your sure?  I was just driving by, and it looked like you needed help.

**Vince**: Well, I don't know much about cars. I just popped the hood so I could look at the engine.

**Tom**: How ong have you been here?

**Vince**: About three hours.

**Tom**: aThree hours?! For a flat tire?

**Vince**: I'm OK, really. I'm just trying to figure out the problem. I think I can do it myself.

**Tom**: You've got a flat tire on the front driver's sid. We need to fix that first.( back passenger side)

**Vince**: Really?

**Tom**: Can't you see it? Your tire needs air! Do you have a spare in your trunk?

**Vince**: I don't know.

**Tom**: Give me your keys. I'll check for you. ( he opens the trunk) See?  You've got a jack and a spare tire here. Let's lift up your car change it.

**Vince**: OK

	(The use the jack to lift the front of the car, replace the flat tire, then lower the car back down.)

**Tom**: Now your tire is all set. Can you try to turn your car on?

**Vince**: (He tries) It still won't start. Are your sure we needed to change the tire?

**Tom**: Of course! Let me take a look... Your fuel gauge is on empty! When was the last time you put gas in your car?

**Vince**:  I have no idea.

**Tom**: Isn't this your car? How could you not know?

**Vince**: Somebody else put gas in it before.

**Tom**: Who? Your parents? Your wife?   Wow, you must be really spoiled. Anyways, I've got a gas can with a few gallons. I'll give you enough to get to a gas station.  ( He puts gas in Vince's tank. Now the car starts.) There you go !

**Vince**: Thank you so much. You've been a big help.

**Tom**: No problem, I'm just glad you're safe. It's dangerous to stand on the side of the road!

**Vince**: Yep.

**Tom**: So...un... You car works now. Aren't you gonna get in and rdive aways?

**Vince**:  I don't know how to drive... and it's not my car.

**Tom**: Not yours????  Whose is it????

**Vince**: I don't know, I was just walking by and I found it here.

**Tom**:  Why didn't you tell me??  We're gonna get in trouble!!

**Vince**: I never asked you to help me. It was your  idea.

**Tom**:  Your're crazy!  I'm outta here!
