# Morning Reading -- CEO

**Linda**: Hey, Bill. Did you get that email from the CEO?

**Bill**: Yeah, what was that about? He wants to see us?

**Linda**: Apparently...

**Bill**: Let me look at my email again... Did you see the time on the email? He sent it at like 3 a.m. last night.

**Linda**: Are you serious? I didn't even notice. It was weird engough that the CEO personally wrote an email to you and me.

**Bill**: I just have so many questions. I mean, have you ever even met the CEO?

**Linda**: No! We've never met, never emailed, never talked on the phone. There are thousands of employees in this company. Why us?

**Bill**: Exactly. Ok, I', looking at it on my phone. So it says: "Dear Bill and Lind, I will be visiting the Seattle office on Saturday at 11 a.m. I would like to have a short meeting with both of you. Please bring a banana and $10. Sincerely, Barney Boppings"

**Linda**: Well, it has to bee the CEO, right? Nobody else in the world has that ridiculous name.

**Bill**: you're right. Our company headquarters is in Miami, isn't it? Why is he coming to our little office in Seattle?

**Linda**: I have no idea. Not to mention, we're an international company. We've been opening offices in Brazil, South Africa, Japan... If anything, he should visit one of those new locations. This Seattle office has been open since 1985, and we only have ten employees.

**Bill**: So, is the banana thing a joke? What about the cash?

**Linda**: Well, I certainly don't have time to buy any fruit today. It's already 10:40 This is crazy.

**Bill**: Honestly, I brought one just in case. And I have $10 in cash.

**Linda**: What?! You actually did it? Are you trying to make me look bad?

**Bill**: Hey, wehn the CEO tells me to do something, I do it. He's our boss's boss's boos.....  like 10 levels up.

**Linda**: I can't believe this. Do you just do whatever people tell you? Don't you think for yourself?

**Bill**:  Like I said, he runs this company. If we want to keep our jobs, we should do what he says.

**Linda**: I don't care. You're crazy. This whole commpany is crazy. You know what, I don't want to work here any more.

**Bill**: Come on, Linda, don't say that. Actually, I brought two banabas in case you needed one.

**Linda**: Wow. That's very thoughtful of you, but it doesn't really solve our problem here. I'm sorry. I quit. (She leaves)

**Bill**: But, but...

(Barney knocks on the door)

**Bill**: Welcome, Sir! You must be Mr.Boppins. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. I'm honored.

**Barney**: Where's Linda?

**Bill**: Unfortunately, Linda just resigned. She was embarrassed about not having a bababa. I brought two, but she...

**Barney**: That was a joke! We're a multi-national corporation! You think I care about a piece of fruit!?  You're fired!

**Bill**: Excuse me?

**Barney**: I don't have time for this! We've got to find Linda!(runs away)

**Bill**:  (speechless)
