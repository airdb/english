# Morning Reading -- Job Interrview

**Sam**:  Ah, Mr. Johnson! It's great to meet you. I'm Mr. Smith, we emailed about the job last week. Anyways, please, call me Sam.

**Jack**: Thanks you, Sam. It's pleasure to meet you too. No need to be formal. Call me jack.

**Sam**: Sure. Please, have a seat, Jack. Can I get you some coffe?

**Jack**: No thanks, I'm fine for now.

**Sam**: Alright. Wel;, I looked over your resume, and I have to say I'm very impressed. But first, just tell me a little about yourself.

**Jack**: Sure. Let's see... I grep up in Chicago, then went to the UNiversity of Illionis for my bachelor's degree. I always liked nature, so I followed my hobby and majored in geology. I just graduated last year, and now I',m looking for jobs.

**Sam**: That sounds great. You found a way to do what you love! So as you know, our company, Oil Corp, specializes in petroleum engineering. Basiclly, we need someone who can analyze land and decide whether we should drill for oil. I assume you studied math, chemistry, and  engineering for your degree?

**Jack**:  Of course! But to be honest, the most important part for me is connecting with nature. I don't want to work in an office. I want to spend my time in the woods, by the rivers, outside in the wild. I like breathing fresh air and feeling the sunshine on my face.

**Sam**:  Oh, you'll certainly have that oopportunity here at Oil Corp. If you are hired, you will spend most of your time outdoors taking measurements of the soil.

**Jack**: Okay, that's perfect. I love the enverironment

**Sam**: Yes...well.. have you researched our company? How much do you know about our history?

**Jack**: Not too much, to be honest.

**Sam**: Oh. In that case, I should let you know that we often cause problems in the environment. Drilling for oil is a dirty business, and accidents will happen. When the oil spills, the ground turns black and the rivers are poisoned. Plus, cars and factories that use the oil pollute the air. Are you comfortable with that part of the jobs?

**Jack**: Oh my goodness... I never thought about that. Maybe I'm in the wrong place. I'm sorry to waste your time.

**Sam**: Now, now... You're not the first person to worry about that. In fact, when I started my job, I was just like you. It's pretty normal here. So, before you leave, there is one last point I want to discuss.

**Jack**: What poing? You are destroying the environment! There's nothing you cloud say to change my mind!

**Sam**:  The starting salary is $150,000 per year.

**Jack**: I see In that case, when do you want me to start?

**Sam**: How about next Monday?

**Jack**: No problem. I'll see you then!

**Sam**: Wonderful! I'm looking froward to having you on our team!
