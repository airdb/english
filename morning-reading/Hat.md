Morning Reading -- Hat

Jim: bob, can I talk to you in my office for a minute?

Bob: Sorry, I'm kind of in the middle of something right now. Can it wait 5 minutes?

Jim: No, I really think we need to have a quick meeting.

Bob: Alright, if you insist. ( They walk to Jim's meeting.

Bob: Alright, if you insist. (They walk to Jim's office)

Jim: Thanks for taking some time out of your schedule for me. I know everybody's busy with the Kempinski project.

Bob: Hey, you're the boss. It's no problem.

Jim: Well, good. So, how's your day going so far?

Bob: I'm fine, Jim, but with all due respect, let's get down to bussiness. What's this about?

Jim: Right, I see. (Sigh) It's the hat. You're wearing that bright read Santa hat, and it's not even Christmas. In fact, it's the middle of July.

Bob: Oh, this thing? I barely noticed it. It was dark in my house when I got dresssed this morning, maybe I put it on by accident.

Jim: Come on, Bob, don't be ridiculous. Nobody accidentally puts on a Santa hat.

Bob: Fair enough. Well, I thought it was stylish. I usually wear pretty boring office clothes, so I wanted shake up the routine.

Jim:  We're not a fashion companym, Bob. We all have serious work to do, and your hat has been distracting us all morning. The entire office has been wondering why you have it.

Bob: I checked the company work manual. There's nothing in our company policy about wearning hats i the office.

Jim: I know but...

Bob: The customers never even see me!  I'm always in the office.

Jim: Look, you can't wear the hat. It's not professional.

Bob: Oh. Can I just say one thing?

Jim: Sure, go ahead.

Bob: 6 5 2 2 4 1.

Jim: Excuse me? Did you just steal my bank account password?!  Are you some king of crazy hacker?

Bob: This is no ordinary hat, Jim. It gives me the power of telepathy. I can read anybody's mind. Pretty amazing, huh?

Jim: I don't believe in silly, magical hats! I'm calling the police!

Bob: I don't think you will.

Jim; What makes you so sure? Can your hat predict the future, too?

Bob: You didn't bring your  phone to work totday. It's still in the back pocket of the pants you wore yesterday, which are laying on your chair at home.

Jim: (Check his pockets, but they are empty) This is incredible. How do you known all that? You've been spying on me, havent't you?

Bob: Magical hat, remember? You know what... I think I'm going home early today. I'll see you tomorrow. 

Jim: You can't just leave! We're not finished talking yet! If you walk out of my office now, you're fired!

Bob: ...and if you fire me, I'll tell everybody in the office what you did last Tuesday at 11:30pm.

Jim; (Gasp) That's blackmail!

Bob: It sure is. Have a nice day, Jim. ( He walks out)
