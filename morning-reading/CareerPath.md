# Morning Reading -- Career Path

[In an office in Singapore.]

**Mr. Zhang**: Thank you for meeting me, June.

**June Tang**: It's my pleasure Mr. Zhang. How'd the dinner with the Kempinski group go last night?

**Zhang**: It went well, thank you for asking. Please, take a seat... How long have you been with us now, June?

**June**: About two years now. I joined around the same time as Kala Singh. We were both put on the Jurong project.

**Zhang**: How are you feeling about your work here?

**June**: .... I feel like we're making a lot of headway. There've been a few snags when dealing with the Construction Authority, but the deputy director's become more open to our proposals after our Macao trip a few weeks ago. She's confident that the director will see the light very soon... You can rest assured, the project is advancing, Mr. Zhang.

**Zhang**: *smiles* I know it it... That's why I'm taking you off of it.

**June**: ...I'm afraid I don't understand.

**Zhang**: Do you feel comfortable here, June?

**June**: Of course, sir!

**Zhang**: It's a long way from back home. Singapore isn't to the liking of everyone.

**June**: I think I've proven time and again that I can thrive in any environment, Mr. Zhang. Is there something specific about my work that you're dissatisfied with?

**Zhang**: No, In fact, just the the opposite. That's why I'm going to give you an opportunity, June. We're opening a new port in the US.

**June**: In the US... You mean we actually got the Baltimore contract? I thought the Germans had already won that!

**Zhang**: Mr. Kohl and the city goverment had a disagreement, apparently. Our terms were much more agreeable. We're going to need a permanent presence there, June. I'm afraid this won't be something you can manage from the cabin of a 787. Can you accept that?

**June**: Of course! This is ex---

**Zhang**: And, more importantly, can your family?

**June**: ...

**Zhang**: Indecision doesn;t suit you, June.

**June**: Yes. Yes, we can.

**Zhang**: *nods* Achmed will take over your team here. Maggie Fan's already in Baltimeore; she's expecting you on the nineteenth. You'll have the details by the end of the day.

**June**: Thanks you, sir.

**Zhang**: ...June. Be caredful over there. Maggie says there's already been one protest organized over the sale of the port. This isn't going to be a popular project and the city council isn't known for its stability.

**June**: We're not known our fragility.

**Zhang**: *smiles*
