	Morning Reading -- Glasses

Jim: Moring, Bob

Bob: Helloooo, Jim! It's a beautiful Tuesday, isn't it? The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and life is full of joy.

Jim: Well, somebody's in a good mood today! What's gotten into you?

Bob: My whole life is gonna change today. I can feel it. Can you feel the excitement, Jim?

Jim: All I feel right now is that I'm a little hungry. I just bought some bagels for the office, but I haven't eaten any yet. Do you want one?

Bob: forget about breakfast! Do you wanna hear some really good news?

Jim: I don't know what's better than bagels. (laughs) Fine, tell me.

Bob: I'm geeting glasses!

Jim: OK, that's nice, I guess. I've never seen you wear glasses. Do you need them? Do you wear contancts now?

Bob: No, I've never worn glasses! I've never even been to an eye doctor before. I grew up kind of poor, and my family couldn't afford to have my eyes checked. Now that I have a job, I finally have health insurance, and I can take a vision test.


Jim: How many fingers am I holding up?  (holds up 2 fingers)

Bob: Six?

Jim: Oh. Yeah, you might wanna get a pair of glasses soon. What time's appoingment?

Bob: 2pm this afternoon. I can't wait!

Jim: Alright, best of luck.

(Bob returns from the appointment, but he looks sad)

Jim: Hey, there he is! Look at him with those fancy new frames! I like the yellow color, it matches your shirt. How did everthing go?

Bob: (long sigh) It's horrible. I can see perfectly now.

Jim: Isn't that a good thing?

Bob: How come nobody told me my clothes never matched? I'm wearing a purple shirt with yellow stripes. And my pants only have one leg. I had no i idea.

Jim: (Laughs)  We just thought that was your style. I guess now you'll start dressing in normal, boring office clothes like the rest of us.

Bob: And, There used to be a pretty girl rode the elevator with me every morning, But it turns out she was an ad on the wall. I thought she was just shy, so she never talked. 

Jim: You gotta be persistent. Mybe if you ask her on a date, she'll say yes!

Bob: I'm serious, Jim! My whole life is a lie.

Jim: Don't say that. You've got a stable job and you're happy with your girlfriend, Ethel, right?

Bob: Jim, my girlfriends is 70 years old! What am I gonna do?

Jim: You didn't know that? We thought you just like older women.

Bob: No! She told me she had a BMW convertible. Every time she drove me somewhere, I could feel the wind in my hair. It turns out, we were just riding her bicycle the whole time.

Jim: It sounds like you really got an education today. Maybe you should go home early today and relax.

Bob: I live under a bridge! I've been paying $2000 a month in rent to a homeless man!  (big joke)

Jim: Oh boy....
